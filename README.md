# Text Processing and Generation Using NLP and Deep Learning
# Overview
This project focuses on text extraction, cleaning, embedding, and generation using advanced NLP techniques and deep learning models. The pipeline includes:

Web scraping with BeautifulSoup

Text cleaning using REGEX

Training Word2Vec embeddings for capturing semantic relationships

Implementing RNN and Transformer-based models for text generation

# Features
✅ Extracts and pre-processes textual data from websites
✅ Cleans data using Regular Expressions (REGEX)
✅ Trains Word2Vec embeddings to understand word relationships
✅ Develops text generation models using:

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

Transformer-based architectures

# Technologies Used
Python

BeautifulSoup (for web scraping)

Regular Expressions (REGEX) (for text cleaning)

Gensim (for Word2Vec embeddings)

TensorFlow / PyTorch (for deep learning models)

NLTK / SpaCy (for additional NLP preprocessing)
